**Data Type**

The concept of data type is crucial in programming language.
Different types of data can be stored in variables, and different types can perform various functions.
The following categories of data types are included by default in Python:

1. Numbers (int, float, complex):
  •	int is not for decimal numbers
  
  •	float is for decimal numbers
  
  •	complex is for imaginary numbers.

2. Sequence type (string, list, tuple):
  •	String (str) is  a data structure of words that stores a sequence of elements, typically characters.
  
  •	List  is items are ordered, changeable, not have to get the same data type, and allow duplicate values. In Python order starts 0 first.
  
  •	Tuple is a collection of objects which ordered and immutable. Tuples are sequences, just like lists. The differences between tuples and lists are,the tuples cannot       be changed unlike lists and tuples use parentheses, whereas lists use square brackets.

3. Boolean (bool): a data type that has only two values, namely true or false

4. Set is an unordered collection of items. Every set element is unique (no duplicates) and must be immutable (cannot be changed).
   However, a set itself is mutable. We can add or remove items from it.
   Sets can also be used to perform mathematical set operations like union, intersection, symmetric difference, etc.

5. Dictionary is an unordered collection of items. Each item of a dictionary has a key/value pair.
   Dictionaries are optimized to retrieve values when the key is known.
