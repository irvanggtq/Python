       int is not for decimal numbers
       float is for decimal numbers
       complex is for imaginary numbers.
  2. String (str):  a data structure of words that stores a sequence of elements, typically characters.
  3. Boolean (bool): a data type that has only two values, namely true or false (true or false).
