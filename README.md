# Description

**Data Type**

The concept of data type is crucial in programming language.
Different types of data can be stored in variables, and different types can perform various functions.
The following categories of data types are included by default in Python:
  1. Numbers (int, float, complex):
       int is not for decimal numbers
       float is for decimal numbers
       complex is for imaginary numbers.
  2. String (str):  a data structure of words that stores a sequence of elements, typically characters.
  3. Boolean (bool): a data type that has only two values, namely true or false (true or false).
  4. List
     List items are ordered, changeable, not have to get the same data type, and allow duplicate values. In Python order starts 0 first
  5. Tuple is a collection of objects which ordered and immutable. 
     Tuples are sequences, just like lists. The differences between tuples and lists are, the tuples cannot be changed unlike lists and tuples use parentheses, whereas       lists use square brackets.
